    // mission control users + space missions here
}
```

## Short description of the Data Model

Here you should describe what each property of data model object does. Remember to list the properties of *both* `mission control users` and `space missions`. Do not forget the properties that you can only see from the sample outputs!

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
|          |      |             |
